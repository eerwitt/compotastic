# Meshtastic Connector

This is the actual connector and executor that can connect to the different Meshtastic nodes and send across a message in compute format including updates for the Q-learning state that each node reads from. For the hackathon the Q-learning implementation is in the simulation only and the attributes are faked for each node on the mesh.
