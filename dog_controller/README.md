# Dog Controller

A simple controller to work with Compot, an example Dog robot implementation based on the simple hardware platform <https://www.hiwonder.com/products/mechdog> running custom framework. Used as an example implementation in the demo. This is meant solely for demo purposes to see physically what it is like to move around the mesh network to provide extra compute. This thing can't hold a raspi let alone a Jetson Thor.
